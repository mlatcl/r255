The opening session will set the context, then we will read the following four papers.}\notes{1.

Computers make decisions on the basis of our data, how can we have confidence in those decisions?}\newslide{}\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/data-science/convention-108-coe}{70%}}{The convention for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data was opened for signature on 28th January 1981.

These simplistic perspctives have also led to a tendency to seek proxies for a notion of "correct" decision making such as consistency. However, in practice uncertainty means that our decisions will often be incorrect. Faced with this incorrectness. Once we accept errors will be made, we can see that making consistent errors is likely to be more harmful than when those errors are inconsistent. }\newslide{Links}\slides{* [This paper on decision making and diversity](http://inverseprobability.com/2017/11/15/decision-making)* [This post on System Zero](http://inverseprobability.com/2015/12/04/what-kind-of-ai/) and [This post on the Mechanistic Fallacy](http://inverseprobability.com/2015/11/09/artificial-stupidity/) relate to the ideas in this talk.* [This post on natural vs artificial systems](http://inverseprobability.com/2018/02/06/natural-and-artificial-intelligence)* Articles in the Guardian are available from my [Guardian Profile Page](http://www.theguardian.com/profile/neil-lawrence)* [My blog](http://inverseprobability.com/blog.html) has articles relating to this area.}\thanks\references
