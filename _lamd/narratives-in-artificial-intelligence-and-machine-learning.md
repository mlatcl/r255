title: "R255: Narratives in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning"
abstract: >
  In this talk we will explore a fundamental limitation of human
  intelligence which, we argue, makes cultural communication vital in sharing ideas. This will motivate the importance of narrative in setting cultural agenda.

\notes{\subsection{Overview}}

\notes{In this topic we will explore the relationship between narrative and the development of machine learning and AI solutions. The course will be taught in collaboration with Nichole Anderson Ravindran and Alessandro Trevisan.}

\notes{You can find text of Alessandro's introduction to narratives [here](https://mlatcl.github.io/r255/assets/pdf/2024-01-19_alessandro-trevisan_R255-introduction-to-narratives.pdf).} 

\notes{How do machine-learning researchers understand the narratives, philosophies, and theories surrounding the present-day understanding of AGI?}

\notes{Can present-day and near-future concerns, issues, and themes be identified and extrapolated from future-oriented AI narratives?}


\notes{We will look at look at different papers related to narratives, philosophies and theories related to artificial intelligence and determine if there are other meaningful ways of identifying problems, themes, and datasets curated based on them.}

\notes{ML Problem: If the AI narratives currently being promoted are seen in some parts of the machine learning community as too speculative or longtermfocused, then how does one extrapolate more near-term problems and themes from them to study within the machine learning community?}

\notes{We will look at look at different papers related to narratives, philosophies and theories related to artificial intelligence and determine if there are other meaningful ways of identifying problems, themes, and datasets curated based on them.}

\notes{The first paper set is:}
